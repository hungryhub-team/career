00.01-00.07 - At this point, I told myself and my partner that if in the next 3 months it does not work, we will close our business.

00.07-00.18 Eventually, I was invited to attend Obama’s meeting. I was asked a lot about my business like what is Hungry Hub’s identity or why people have to download your application. 

00.18- 00.28Plus, you have to be able to respond to those answers. For instance, if your answer is convenience, you have to be sure that people are willing to pay for those convenience but if it does not go that way, it means it is not working. 

00.35- 00.43Hungry Hub is the startup company for reserving restaurants via an online platform. Our ultimate goal is to make customers be able to reserve for 24 hours without calling restaurants. 

00.46-00.54It started in 2014 when we began to build the software and talk to restaurants. At the end of 2014, we had around 30-40 restaurants then we launched our business. 

00.55-1.06In the early of 2015, we started to apply public relations like newspapers, television programmes so people will come to us and download our application. However, it did not meet our expectations. 

1.07-1.14 It is the real way to waste money as quickly as possible. I used 400,000 - 500,000 baht for public relations and we got nothing back.

1.17- 1.24 I was only concerned about the restaurant's side. Did they want to stay with us? Yet, I forgot to ask our customers who make our income as they use our service but the restaurant only provides for us. 

1.27- 1.37For the purpose of the restaurant, they want to increase the selling point not by arranging a reservation. So, we did not know the solution for this point. I thought the reservation would help. 

1.38- 1.44 These days we have a few ways to extend the selling point like discount or give away. 
1.48-1.55 In the market, there are a bunch of businesses that play with discounts such as 50% discount which they may see as the way to increase the reservation during the low demand to be the sub selling path.

1.58-2.00 Restaurants are looking for a way to extend their main income without giving many discounts. 

2.03- 2.11On the contrary: customers, when there are companies eating, billing is always out of control. 

2.12- 2.18There are various menus from fried rice to lobster so many employees will choose to eat lobster. 
2.19-2.28 So, we think that if there is anything that both serves for socializing and controlling the budget then it becomes the new model business of Hungry Hub

2.31 - 2.38These days, I want people to know the pricing and menu before getting into the restaurants. 

2.39 -2.42 For the restaurants part, I want them to gain more selling points without discounting. 

2.46 - 2.51Today, we are at  Banyan Tree Bangkok, which is one of our partners . We have been partners for almost 3 years 

 2.53- 3.08and the starting price is 1400 baht per person including appetizer buffet and 1 mocktail. When you arrive at the place, you have to show your reservation number to the staff.

A :Hello, I made a reservation for today 
B: Can I have your name?
A: Surasit
A :Then, they will take you to the reserved table.
B: Here is the table
A: ok, Thank you
B: Please take off your shoes inside. 
A: Ok

3.29- 3.40 This is a Hungry Hub menu which is chosen from the main menu from restaurants for 20-30 menus.

3.41- 3.44 Every price in Hungry Hub is the net price. 

3.45- 3.48Hungry Hub’s concept is that we will know everything before going to restaurants. Thus, we don’t want any complications.

3.56- 4.06It has changed a lot. For the first day, we focus on the quantity of reservations but today I focus on the quality of food instead. 

4.07- 4.17These days, we have to select the restaurant even though there are many restaurants that have applied to us with the offer. 

4.18- 4.34When we deny some restaurants, it does not mean we don’t want to increase the selling point but we know that if they join us, we still can’t make their sales since its promotion is not attractive to customers and the restaurant will think that Hungry Hub is not effective. 

Q: Do you have any suggestions for the new generation who are interested in startup business?
Khun Sit : You have to be tough and be sure that there is a real problem to solve. It means that you have to assure that these problems happen to real customers. We have to think as customers that they will be able to spend on your service to eliminate those problems. 
This is what I think if you can solve the problem and make sure that it is going to happen, you are on the half way to success.
