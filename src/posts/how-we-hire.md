## WORK FROM ANYWHERE

Wherever you are, your next journey starts here. Organize your work and life in a way that’s energizing and sustainable for you, while being supported by us. You can work from our Bangkok (Thailand) or Malang (Indonesia) office too.

## WHO WE HIRE

Growth mindsets over comfort zones

As we grow, we’re committed to nurturing a culture of trust and autonomy. We’re humble about what we know and what we don’t, and we’re looking for people who can champion that mindset with their peers and managers alike.

## THE LIFE STORY INTERVIEW

Designed to help us get to know you

You're more than just the accomplishments on your resume. The Life Story interview is a two-sided conversation where we'll cover your professional and personal experience so far. You can expect us to ask questions that touch on these five topics.

### Impact

Do you make things better not only for yourself, but for those around you?

### Readiness

Do you have the skills or potential to do the job you’re applying for?

### Trust

Are you able to communicate authentically and do you have a history of building high trust with others?

### Engagement

Do you have a high degree of care for what you do in work and in life?

### Self-awareness

Do you have an understanding of your strengths and also how you impact those around you?





## THE PROCESS

From submit to success

### 1. Apply

Select 1–2 roles that you believe are the best fit for yourself and your career. Don’t forget to check the requirements before you submit, as each role may have different ones.

### 2. Initial call

Depending on the role, we may set up a 15–30 minute phone or virtual conversation with a recruiter or hiring manager, where you can ask questions and tell us what you’re interested in. Get the intel on who you’ll meet and technical exercises. We’ll also use this information to help explore other roles that may be a better fit. For R&D applicants, you'll pass this step and go directly into a coding exercise before heading to The Life Story; a member of the Talent Acquisition team will share all the details!

### 3. The Life Story

A one hour, conversation-style interview with a recruiter. The best way to prep is to spend some time thinking about experiences that have been formative to the point you’re at today.

A word of advice from more introverted folks at Shopify: This part can be as personal as you want it to be. Get technical, if that's where your passions live.

### 4. Meet the team

You’ll meet with 3–5 future co-workers for up to an hour each. Depending on the role, we may ask how you’d solve a problem and communicate it to the team. Learn more about our [R&D](https://shopify.engineering/), [case studies](https://www.shopify.com/plus/customers), or the [team](https://www.shopify.com/careers/teams) you’ll be meeting.

### 5. Decision

Your hiring team will take the time to meet before getting back to you. This will be made based on feedback from Shopify team members of varying levels of seniority, experiences, and perspectives.
